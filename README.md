## Oral Cancer Detection Using Deep Learning
Overview
This repository contains a deep learning model designed to predict oral cancer from images. Leveraging advanced Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), this project aims to address the lack of screening programs for oral cancer by providing an effective tool for early detection.

## Introduction
Deep learning has revolutionized fields such as computer vision and NLP due to its powerful feature extraction capabilities. This project applies these advancements to healthcare, specifically for the early detection of oral cancer, which is crucial due to the high morbidity and mortality associated with late diagnoses. Our CNN models are fine-tuned to classify oral cancer images with high accuracy, contributing significantly to potential screening processes.

## Project Highlights
Advanced CNN Architectures: Utilizes state-of-the-art neural networks that have excelled in major challenges like the ImageNet LSVRC.
High Accuracy Classification: Designed to achieve high performance in image-based detection tasks.

Impactful Healthcare Application: The urgent need for early oral cancer detection tools is addressed.

## Tech Stack
Python: For overall programming.

TensorFlow/Keras: For building and training the deep learning models.

OpenCV: For image processing tasks.

NumPy/Pandas: For data manipulation.

## Model Architecture
The CNN architecture used in this project mimics the animal visual cortex, featuring multiple layers that learn to identify distinctive features in images that are indicative of oral cancer. The convolutional layers, which are central to this architecture, convolve input with learned kernels, producing feature maps that enhance the model's predictive accuracy.
